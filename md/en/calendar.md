# Calendar

In the top right corner of the calendar view, you can switch between monthly calendar view and scrolling calendar view.

## Calendar Images

The image on the calendar is: the first image from the earliest diary entry of that day.

If you need to customize the image, you can click the "Customize Calendar Image" button, which will create a diary entry at 00:01 of that day. Then select an image to add, and you can achieve the effect of customizing the calendar image.
