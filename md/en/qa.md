# Frequently Asked Questions

## Data Privacy & Security

### Why is there no account login?
Lifelog Note is designed with privacy first - all data is stored only locally on your phone. There's no account system, we don't host your data, and we absolutely respect user privacy. Users can import/export or backup data themselves. 

### What if I lose my data?
Lifelog Note is designed with privacy first - all data is stored only locally on your phone. Users can import/export data or backup data themselves, and restore from backup after changing phones. If users haven't backed up their data, there's no other way to recover it.

### What if data export has issues?
Is your app version very old? Very old versions may have data export issues. If there are no signature issues, please upgrade to the latest version before exporting. (Please remember to update regularly - I frequently release various fixes). If there are signature issues and you haven't completed backup (export data or backup to cloud), don't uninstall yet. First backup to cloud or try re-exporting and importing until the exported data works properly.

## Backup/Device Migration

### Migration via Cloud Storage
Before deleting data on your old phone, complete these steps:
1. Successfully backup and upload all data via iCloud or WebDAV in the backup section (it's best to backup regularly - incremental backup. Waiting until phone change may result in long upload times or exceed cloud storage upload limits)
2. On your new phone, click "Delete local data & download cloud backup to overwrite" in the backup section to download data from cloud and overwrite locally
3. Ensure new phone has the data
4. Finally, delete data from old phone or discard it

### Data Import/Export
Before deleting data on your old phone, complete these steps:
1. In settings, go to import/export page, click export to export zip file
2. Import the zip file on your new phone (if zip file is too large, it may fail or take a long time - recommend using cloud backup for daily backups)
3. Ensure new phone has the data
4. Finally, delete data from old phone or discard it

### WebDAV Backup Instructions
When using WebDAV backup, please first check the WebDAV tutorials and limitations for different cloud platforms. When using WebDAV backup in Lifelog Note, please wait patiently for upload; after all backup is complete, it will show the last backup time. During backup, keep Lifelog Note app in foreground - don't switch out or lock screen. Backup is incremental and won't re-upload everything each time. If cloud has limitations and fails, you can click to continue backup again. Currently WebDAV backup is not recommended - iCloud backup and Alibaba Cloud Drive backup are recommended instead.

## Membership

### Membership Purchase & Migration
Android and iOS memberships are not interchangeable - you need to purchase separately for each platform. But data is interchangeable - you can freely import/export data to migrate between iOS and Android.

### Android Membership Account System
Android now supports membership account system. Users can login with the email address bound during previous redemption (emails bound with previous redemption codes don't have passwords set - for first login, click "Forgot Password" first, receive verification code via email to reset password, then login with account and password directly). If your previously entered email address can't receive verification codes, contact me via Alipay for troubleshooting.

### iOS Membership Restoration
For iOS membership, directly click "Restore Purchase" in the top right corner of the in-app membership page.

To combat piracy, protect developer rights, and ensure optimal app maintenance, we verify your member App Store account.

Membership privileges are linked to the Apple ID used for the original purchase. Please log in to the App Store using that Apple ID. Additionally, ensure the app was downloaded with this same account and that your account's region has not been switched. (If not, please switch back to the Apple ID used for the in-app purchase, redownload the app, then switch your account back to the region where the in-app purchase was made, and tap "Restore Purchases" again.)


### How to migrate membership after changing Android phones
Android now supports membership account system. Users can login with the email address bound during previous redemption (emails bound with previous redemption codes don't have passwords set - for first login, click "Forgot Password" first, receive verification code via email to reset password, then login with account and password directly). If your previously entered email address can't receive verification codes, contact me via Alipay for troubleshooting.

## Technical Issues
