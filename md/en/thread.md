# Diary Thread

Diary Thread is a signature feature of Lifelog Note that allows users to record and view events from multiple timelines. This means users can connect different notes according to their needs to form a complete story.

In the bottom right corner of diary entries on the homepage and in the diary detail page, there is a "three bars" icon button. Click this button to create a new diary entry to "record the follow-up", which forms a diary thread with the current diary entry.

Click "Show Current Diary Thread" to display all related diary entries in chronological order.

In the leftmost tab page at the bottom, all your "threads" will be listed for easy viewing.
