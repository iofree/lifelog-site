# Device Migration - Data Transfer

## Migration via Cloud Storage

Before deleting data from your old phone, you need to complete the following steps:

1. Successfully backup and upload all data through iCloud or WebDAV in the backup section (it's best to backup regularly on a daily basis with incremental backups, as waiting until device migration may result in long upload times or exceeding cloud storage upload limits)
2. On your new phone, click "Delete Local Data & Download Cloud Backup to Overwrite" in the backup section to download data from the cloud and overwrite local data
3. Ensure the new phone has the data

Finally, delete data from the old phone or discard it.

## Data Import and Export

Before deleting data from your old phone, you need to complete the following steps:

1. In settings, go to the import/export page and click export to export a zip file.
2. Import the zip file on your new phone (if the zip file is too large, it may fail or take a long time, so daily cloud backup is recommended)

Finally, delete data from the old phone or discard it.
