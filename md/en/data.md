# Data Import and Export

In addition to the cloud backup feature, you can still export all data yourself. The format of exported data is the same as cloud backup.

The exported data can be imported back into the app, which has the same effect as restoring data from the cloud to local storage.

## Export

At the bottom of settings, click "Data Import and Export".

Click "Export". During this process, do not turn off the screen, do not switch out of the app, and do not use split screen mode.

## Import

At the bottom of settings, click "Data Import and Export".

Click "Import", then select the data you exported from the "Lifelog Note" app. It must be data exported from this app, not other phone backup data or similar.

During this process, do not turn off the screen, do not switch out of the app, and do not use split screen mode.
