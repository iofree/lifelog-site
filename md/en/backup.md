# Backup

Lifelog Note supports iCloud backup (iOS only), Alibaba Cloud Drive, and WebDAV cloud backup.

## iCloud Backup (iOS only)

iCloud backup requires enabling two switches in the phone's system settings:
- iCloud Drive
- Lifelog Note switch in iCloud

After both system switches are enabled, you can perform backups in the app.

## WebDAV Backup

WebDAV backup requires the cloud storage to support the WebDAV protocol. Currently, only Nutstore (坚果云) is known to support this.

For configuration details, see [Lifelog Note WebDAV Tutorial](https://docs.qq.com/doc/DVHJhRU9ubVNBblhR)

## Backup Now

After configuring the cloud storage, click "Backup Now" on the backup page to start backing up. During backup, do not turn off the screen, do not switch out of the app, and do not use split screen mode.

## Restore from Last Backup

This button means downloading data from the cloud and then overwriting local data.

It is generally used when a new device has just installed the app and can restore previously backed up data from the cloud.
